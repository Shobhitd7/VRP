# VRP
This is the solution to a VRP problem. The code is pretty straightforward to implement. Please run shobhit_solution_vrp.py locally on your device(Install all required dependencies) and run evaluateShared.py. Then run this command 
"python3 evaluateShared.py --cmd ./shobhit_solution_vrp.py --problemDir (folder containing the training problems)"
on your terminal with all the required data which is in the format of multiple .txt files in a folder(Keeping the data secure and cannot provide it, you can use your own data where each line would have the load number, pickup and dropoff points). evaluateShared.py helps to validate the results.
