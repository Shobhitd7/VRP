# VRP
This is the solution to a VRP problem. The code is pretty straightforward to implement. Please run shobhit_solution_vrp.py locally on your device(Install all required dependencies) and run evaluateShared.py. Then run this command 
"python3 evaluateShared.py --cmd ./shobhit_solution_vrp.py --problemDir (folder containing the training problems)"
on your terminal with all the required data which is in the format of multiple .txt files in a folder. evaluateShared.py helps to validate the results.
